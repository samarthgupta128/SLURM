# hpc-learning
This repository is used to organize learning materials for HPC and related fields. Due to my limited capabilities and the vast amount of HPC-related content, we welcome your submissions and contributions.

I also recommend the [CS Self-Study Guide](https://csdiy.wiki/), a great resource compiled by a Peking University graduate. For resources I haven't mentioned here, I recommend checking it out.
